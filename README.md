## Results

### Deliverable 1

This deliverable consists of a Jupyter Notebook named mission_to_mars_challenge.ipynb. The code for web scraping the full-resolution images and titles of the Martian hemispheres is included a the end of the file.  

### Deliverable 2

For this deliverable the file scraping.py was updated with a new function containing the code that was developed in the previous deliverable. the template index.html was updated with code to properly display the newly scaped images and titles. 

### Deliverable 3

For the final deliverable two additional bootstrap components we added to the index.html file. First the sizing of the hemisphere images was adjusted so that they fit in a single row across the webpage. Secondly the headers of each container were adjusted to be consistent size and underlines are added to make them stand out more.
